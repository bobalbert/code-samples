Mequoda Haven Order Manager
=====================
As part of the Recurly integration with Mequoda sites, customer service tools were needed.

This plugin is a set of customer service tools that allow CS agent to create, edit and delete Recurly Plans which define subscription price and term.  Further CS agents can fully administer subscriptions to create, cancel, refund and edit existing subscriptions keeping them in sync between the two sites. 

This plugin works along side the main [Haven Recurly plugin](https://github.com/bobalbert/code-samples/tree/master/Mequoda/haven-recurly/)
