Catch of the Day
===================
To start to learn about React I went through the Wes Boss' [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course. In the course, we will build “Catch of the Day” — a real-time app for a trendy seafood market where price and quantity available are variable and can change at a moment's notice. This app includes a menu, an order form, and an inventory management area where authorized users can immediately update product details.

This gave me a great foundation in React to better understand how to build custom WordPress Blocks.
