Haven AAA Automated Subscriber Reconciliation
=====================
Mequoda was hired to convert the [AAA Northeast's online magazine site](https://magazine.northeast.aaa.com/) and increase subscriptions. Along with being integral in the creation of the new site, one project I did was to automate the process to add and remove customers from the print issue.

Prior to the creation of this plugin, various Excel docs were used to manually compare exports of user data and create lists for the print vendor.

This plugin runs on a monthly cron job and pragmatically creates the lists and emails them to the client. Further there is an admin interface that allows the client to manually download the monthly files.
