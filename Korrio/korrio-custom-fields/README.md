Korrio Custom Fields plugin
===================

This plugin manages what we call Custom Fields that a customer can setup and add to their registration/order path allowing them to collect custom data from the customer registering. Typically for our sports clubs this is information about uniform sizes, if they would like to return to last year's team, what team they prefer, etcâ€¦ The club has the option of creating several input fields including text, text area, simple yes no and multi radio buttons.

The plugin code is mainly around the creation, edit and management of the custom fields at the club level. There is another aspect that this sample doesn't cover fully that I was also involved which included the interface to set what custom fields would be assigned to which program/order path as well as in implementing the display of the custom fields in registration along with collection and storage after purchase for the user. Also we expose these fields after registration on team rosters as well as custom reports to help club admins make decisions around what team to roster kids to which i was also responsible for implementing.

The sample is an example of a "full stack" implementation from creating the database tables, model code to store and retrieve as well as front end interface to create and edit.
