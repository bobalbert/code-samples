Text-Box Block
===================
In learning how to build custom blocks, I created this Text-Box custom block. Although this does the same type of things existing core blocks already do this was built from the ground up. 

As I work through the [WordPress Blocks Editor Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/) and my [Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress and React Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/gutenberg/) course, I will be updating this particular block.
